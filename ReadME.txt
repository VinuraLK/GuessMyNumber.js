- App saves a random number to a variable so that the user input can be 
compared and checked if equal
- uses if statements to figure out if the user input is equal to the random
 number generated
- uses event handling to take the user input and save it in a variable
- if the user input number is greater or lesser a message is printed out 
saying the guess is wrong and whether the random number is greater than or 
equal to the guessed number
- starts with a score of 20 and each time the user gets a guess wrong the
 score decreases by 1
- when the user guesses the right number the background color of the page 
will change to green and a message will be shown saying the number is right
 and that the user won the game (the css style of the box showing the number will
 be made bigger)
